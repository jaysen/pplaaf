		<h3>Send us an encrypted email using PGP Encryption</h3>
		<p>Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is a way to protect your email communications from being read by anyone except their intended recipients. It can protect against companies, governments, or criminals reading your email by spying on your Internet connection. You can find out more about sending encrypted emails at the <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/communicating-others#5" target="blank">Electronic Frontier Foundation's guide to secure communications</a>.</p>
			
		<p>Alternatively you can send PGP encrypted emails by installing the <a href="https://www.mailvelope.com/en/" target="blank">Mailvelope</a> browser plugin that can be used with popular browser-based email services like Gmail, Yahoo and Outlook.com. We have recorded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Nsl6DRsTuM" target="blank">a simple video guide to installing and using Mailvelope</a> that includes an explanation on how to find and import the public PGP key for <a href="mailto:info@pplaaf.org">info@pplaaf.org</a> using <a href="https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x515F32594CC1C1C3" target="blank">this PGP key</a></p>
		
		<p>You can also send a PGP encrypted email directly to one of the following recipients using the public PGP keys linked below:</p>
