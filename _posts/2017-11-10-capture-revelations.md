**(Johannesburg – November 10 2017) – On October 31 and November 2017  Bianca Goodson and Mosilo Mothepu, former CEOs of Gupta-linked Trillian testified in South Africa's parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Public Enterprises (Eskom Inquiry).**

**Corroborating accounts coupled with annexures unraveled the role of Trillian and key associates of the Gupta family in accessing insider information and siphoning billions from state-owned entities such as Transnet and Eskom in collusion with Ministers and other public officials, and multinationals such as McKinsey and SAP. Testimonies were provided under the umbrella of parliamenntary immunity.**

Goodson's statement was [previously released by PPLAAF](https://pplaaf.in/trillian-bg/) on September 27th 2017. On November 3, Goodson made accessible her a copy of her Trillian computer including her all historical emails, curated for privacy. Mothepu's statement was provided to members of parliament and select journalists. Mothepu continues to face criminal and civil charges laid by Trillian and has since been accused of perjury by Gupta-associate and Trillian CEO, Eric Wood. 

Following a request from the Honorable Acting Chair of the Éskom Inquiry' to publish "select extracts of Guptaleaks on our site', PPLAAF curated speciifc interactions around themes such as Eskom, Transnet, Ministers, Bell Pottinger, KPMG, SAA and Denel among others. (<https://pplaaf.in/gleaks/>)
The disclosure, meant to show interactions between key persons and entities, is [publicly accessible](https://pplaaf.in/gleaks/) for a period of ten days. " 

PPLAAF complied because we believe it is important for citizens to directly access a glimpse of the information - and intimately familiar ways in which public officials and the Gupta family and their associates, interacted to understand the depth and ease with which "state capture"occurred at the highest level of political power and influence. 

In partnership with amaBhungane and Daily Maverick - original receivers of the Guptaleak alongside PPLAAF, the organisation has opted to provide access to the information via a single portal - Investigative Dashboard, that will soon be available to global media via the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) with the support of Finance Uncovered.
