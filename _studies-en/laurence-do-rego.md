name: Laurence do Rego
title: From Shunned Whistleblower to Top Executive
---
With a decade of experience behind her, Laurence do Rego began her career with Ecobank in 2002 as a financial controller in her home country of Benin. Soon she was promoted to controller for the bank’s parent company, ETI, and in 2005 she became Ecobank’s Chief Financial Officer. 

In 2010 do Rego was named African Businesswoman of the Year by the Commonwealth Business Council. Her career with ETI, a Togo-based bank with offices throughout West and Central Africa, seemed secure.

In August 2013 she was <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d080f8b2-2152-11e3-8aff-00144feab7de">suspended</a> – and later fired – from Ecobank’s Nigerian office after reporting alleged unethical practices and breaches in corporate governance. Bank managers flung accusations at do Rego. Colleagues came to her defense.

The following February, Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission ordered Ecobank to reinstate do Rego as Executive Director of Finance and Risk. The decision was in keeping with Nigeria’s regulatory laws.

While few reinstated whistleblowers are able to fully regain their reputation in their former workplace, and even fewer advance in their career, do Rego continued her upward climb.

African Business named her one of “<a href="http://africanbusinessmagazine.com/company-profile/ecobank/15-ceos-watch-2015-laurence-rego/">15 CEOs to watch in 2015</a>.” The magazine wrote of do Rego, “A woman of conviction and principles, she fought for the integrity of the bank and took huge personal risks. She never doubted during the whole crisis that the fight was worth it and that she would win in the end. It was a victory for the whistleblower, who survived attempts to discredit her professional qualifications and emerged from the farrago with her integrity intact.”

The following year, in May 2016, ETI appointed do Rego as Group Executive of Commercial Banking. The bank praised her for her role in expanding its reach from 12 to 40 countries and moving into East and Southern Africa.


These cases, amongst others, are relevant to understand the situation of whislteblowers in Africa.
